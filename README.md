### Venue Crowd Recognition in Dense Smoke Environment: A Recognition Method Based on Attention Mechanism Fusion Segmentation Instances


Abstract:

The occurrence of fires poses a significant threat to pedestrian safety in densely populated venues, presenting a major challenge in enhancing pedestrian evacuation speed and rescue efficiency. This paper proposes a computer vision approach by augmenting target pedestrian recognition with a Mask branch on top of object detection algorithms, utilizing channel attention mechanisms to enhance target pedestrians in the environment while reducing the weighting of the environment in images. We introduce a YOLOv8-Mask model which effectively enhances pedestrian recognition in hazy scenes typical of fire-smoke environments, facilitating efficient rescue operations for trapped individuals. Finally, comparative experiments conducted on self-collected datasets with five established object detection models demonstrate the superiority, robustness, and effectiveness of our proposed model in crowd recognition under such hazy conditions and real-world scenarios. The research outcomes presented herein contribute to assisting rescue efforts in densely populated venues amidst fire-smoke conditions, thereby providing technological support for the development of resilient cities.
